                    Kinematics is employed to establish connections between
                    displacement, velocity, acceleration, and time, independent
                    of the factors driving the motion. This discussion will
                    focus on the kinematics of objects, regardless of whether
                    they are as small as particles or as large as humans,
                    automobiles, rockets, or airplanes, without taking into
                    account their specific shape and size.

                    Distance represents the total length traveled by a moving
                    particle or object within a specified time frame. It is
                    denoted by S generally.
                  </p>
                  <p>SI unit of distance is m. And it is a scalar quantity.</p>
                  <h5 class="text-muted">
                    <strong>Displacement</strong>
                  </h5>
                  <p>
                    The displacement denotes the alteration in the position
                    vector, specifically, the vector connecting the initial and
                    final positions. In short displacement is the shortest
                    possible path between the initial and final position.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It's SI unit is m. And obviusly it is a vector quantity.

                  <p>
                    If a particle journeys from point A to point C along the
                    route ABC as shown below
                  </p>
                  <div class="text-center">
                    <img src="dnd.png" alt="" class="cm" />
                  </div>

                  <p>
                    The distance covered corresponds to the actual path length
                    ABC, whereas the displacement can be expressed as:
                    \[\Delta{r} = \vec{r} = \vec{r_c} - \vec{r_a} \]
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When a particle undergoes motion in a straight line without
                    any change in direction, the magnitude of its displacement
                    is equivalent to the distance traveled. However, in cases
                    where the particle changes direction during its motion, the
                    displacement is consistently less than the total distance
                    traveled. Thus,
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    The instantaneous velocity of a particle at a given time
                    \(t\) is defined as follows. Consider the average velocity
                    of the particle over a very short time interval from \(t\)
                    to \(t + \Delta t\), denoted as \(\vec{v}_{\text{avg}}\).
                    This average velocity can be expressed as: \[
                    \vec{v}_{\text{avg}} = \frac{\Delta \vec{r}}{\Delta t} \]
                    Here, \(\Delta \vec{r}\) represents the displacement that
                    occurs during the time interval \(\Delta t\).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Now, as we reduce \(\Delta t\) to an infinitesimally small
                    value, we can determine the limit of \(\frac{\Delta
                    \vec{r}}{\Delta t}\) as \(\Delta t\) approaches zero. This
                    limit represents the instantaneous velocity \(\vec{v}\) of
                    the particle at time \(t\), and it can be expressed as: \[
                    \vec{v} = \lim_{{\Delta t \to 0}} \frac{\Delta
                    \vec{r}}{\Delta t} = \frac{d\vec{r}}{dt} \] In this context,
                    \(\frac{d\vec{r}}{dt}\) signifies the rate of change of the
                    displacement vector \(\vec{r}\) with respect to time \(t\),
                    which gives the instantaneous velocity of the particle at
                    the specific time \(t\).
                  </p>
                  <h5 class="text-muted">Instantaneous Speed</h5>
                  <p>
                    For very small time intervals, the displacement \(\Delta
                    \vec{r}\) occurs along the path of the particle's motion. In
                    this case, the magnitude of \(\Delta \vec{r}\) is equal to
                    the distance \(\Delta s\) traveled during that interval.
                    Therefore, the magnitude of velocity is given by: \[v =
                    \left|\frac{d\vec{r}}{dt}\right| = \frac{|\Delta
                    \vec{r}|}{\Delta t} = \frac{\Delta s}{\Delta t} \]
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This magnitude represents the instantaneous speed at time
                    \(t\). Simply instantaneous speed ia the magnitude of
                    instantaneous velocity and can be mathematically expressed
                    as: \[v = |\vec{v}| \]

                  <p>
                    Average acceleration is defined as the ratio of the change
                    in velocity, denoted as \(\Delta \vec{v}\), to the time
                    interval \(\Delta t\) during which this change takes place.
                    Therefore, the average acceleration
                    (\(\vec{a}_{\text{avg}}\)) is calculated as follows: \[
                    \vec{a}_{\text{avg}} = \frac{\Delta \vec{v}}{\Delta t} =
                    \frac{\vec{v_f} - \vec{v_i}}{\Delta t} \] Here,
                    \(\vec{v_f}\) represents the final velocity vector, and

                    When a particle is constrained to move along a straight
                    line, the description becomes relatively straightforward.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We select the straight line as the X-axis and designate a
                    convenient moment in time as \(t = 0\). Typically, the
                    origin is defined at the location where the particle is
                    positioned at \(t = 0\).

                  <p>
                    The particle's position at any given time \(t\) is then
                    represented by its coordinate \(x\) at that time. The
                    velocity of the particle, in this context, is a measure of
                    how the position \(x\) changes concerning time \(t\) can be
                    written as: \[\vec{v} = \frac{d{\vec{x}}}{dt} \]

                  <p>
                    And the acceleration can be expressed as: \[\vec{a} =
                    \frac{d{\vec{v}}}{dt} =
                    \frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{d{\vec{x}}}{dt}\right) =

                        <p>
                          At \(t\) = 0 the particle is at \(x\) = 0. As time
                          changes from 0 to \(t\) the position changes from 0 to

                          of the Earth (approximately 6400 kilometers). This
                          constant acceleration is approximately equal to

                          the displacement (\(y\)) in the Y-direction. It
                          demonstrates how the velocity changes as an object

                          In these equations, \(u\) is the initial velocity in
                          the Y-direction at time \(t = 0\), \(v\) is the
                          velocity in the Y-direction at time \(t\), and \(y\)
                          is the displacement (height above the origin) at time
                          \(t\). The negative sign in the acceleration term (-g)
                          signifies that gravity acts in the negative
                          Y-direction. These equations are fundamental in the

                          An example of motion in a straight line can be when a
                          body is thrown vertically upwards from the Earth's
                          surface. In this scenario, when we neglect air
                          resistance and the body will follow a vertical
                          straight motion.This type of motion is often referred
                          to as "vertical projectile motion."

                        <p>
                          The motion involves two directions: ascending and
                          descending. As the object moves upward, it eventually
                          reaches its highest point before beginning its
                          descent.

                          acceleration due to gravity acting downward.

                    + \Delta x, y + \Delta y)\). In Figure, positions at \(t\)
                    and \(t + \Delta t\) are marked as points A and B,
                    respectively. The displacement during the time interval from
                    \(t\) to \(t + \Delta t\) can be determined as the vector
                    connecting points A and B.

                  <p>
                    \(x\) component of velocity can be written as: \(v_x =

                    written as: \(v_y = \frac{dy}{dt} \)
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Similarly, \(x\) component of acceleration can be written
                    as: \(a_x = \frac{dv_x}{dt} \) | \(y\) component of

                    Thus, if \(a_x \) is constant, the equations of motion we

                    Projectile motion is a fundamental example of motion in a
                    two-dimensional plane characterized by constant
                    acceleration. When an object is launched at an angle to the
                    Earth's surface, it follows a curved trajectory. This object
                    is typically referred to as a projectile, and its motion is
                    described as projectile motion.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In our analysis, we will assume that the projectile remains
                    in close proximity to the Earth's surface, and we'll neglect
                    the influence of air resistance. Under these conditions, the
                    acceleration of the projectile is approximately constant,
                    directed vertically downward, with a magnitude of about 9.8
                    m/s\(^2 \), typically denoted as \(g\)

                    angle \(\theta \) with respect to the horizontal direction.

                    The word 'relative' is a very general term, which can be
                    applied to physical, nonphysical, scalar or vector
                    quantities.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For example, earth is at rest relative to us but it is in
                    motion relative to any other planet or sun. It totally
                    depends which 'frame of reference' we are chosing to say
                    whether the earth is at rest or in motion.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Let's take another example. My height is 6 ft and yours is 5
                    ft and The Great Kahli has a height of 7 ft. Relative to me
                    he is 1 ft ahead of me but relative to you he is ahead of 2
                    ft.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Till yet we are taking all the objects relative to ground.

                  <p>
                    One another beautiful example, You are in a train which is
                    moving with 100 km/hr with respect to ground. But relative
                    to you, train is at rest. This can be mathematically
                    expressed as: \[\text{Speed of Train with respect to Ground:
                    } V_{\text{Train, Ground}} = 100km/hr \] \[\text{Speed of Train with respect to You: } V_{\text{Train, You}} = 0 \]

                    Imagine two frames of reference, denoted as S and S′, each
                    potentially in relative motion with respect to the other.
                    Within this scenario, let's observe a particle named P from
                    both frames. The figure visually represents this situation.

                    \) = \(\vec{\text{O'P}} \). Additionally, the position of
                    frame \(S' \), which is essentially the origin of frame \(S'
                    \), with respect to frame \(S \) is denoted as
                    \(\vec{\text{OO'}} \).

                  <p>
                    It can be observed that \[\vec{OP} = \vec{OO'} + \vec{O'P} =
                    \vec{O'P} + \vec{OO'} \] \[\vec{r}_\text{P,S} =
                    \vec{r}_\text{P,S'} + \vec{r}_\text{S,S'} \] The position of
                    the particle with respect to \(S\) is equal to the position
                    of the particle with respect to \(S'\) plus the position of
                    \(S'\) with respect to \(S\).

                    Differentiating the above and we will get:

                        <p>
                          When two bodies are in motion, questions such as
                          determining the minimum distance between them or the
                          time at which one body overtakes the other can be
                          readily solved using the principle of relative motion.
                          In these types of problems, one body is typically
                          treated as if it were at rest, and the motion of the
                          other body is analyzed relative to this assumed
                          stationary reference. This simplifies the problem,
                          effectively converting a two-body problem into a
                          one-body problem, making it easier to find a solution.

                            At time t = 0, car A is 10 \(m\) behind car B. Find
                            the time when car A overtakes car B.</strong
                          >
                          <br />
                          <strong>Solution:</strong> Given, \(u_A = 0\), \(u_B =
                          1m/s\), \(a_A = 4 m/s^2 \) and \(a_B = 0\).
                          <br />
                          We will solve this relative to A, we have
                          <br />
                          \(u_{\text{AB}} = u_A - u_B = 0-1 = -1 m/s \)
                          <br />
                          \(a_{\text{AB}} = a_A - a_B = 4-0 = 4 m/s^2 \)
                          <br />
                          Initially A is 10 m behind B. Then \[s = ut +
                          \frac{1}{2}at^2 \] \[10 = -t + \frac{1}{2}4t^2 \]
                          \[2t^2 -t -10 = 0 \] \[t = 2.5 s \text{ and} -2s \]
                          Ignoring the negative value, the desired time is 2.5s.
